          Welcome to my blog. <br /> I‚Äôm <strong>Emanuele Di Pietro</strong>, an{" "}
          <strong>iOS/Web developer</strong> with a background from the Apple
          Developer Academy. I build apps and websites, experiment with new

          Technology has always been a passion of mine, but it's not the only
          one. I also have a strong interest in <strong>fitness</strong>,
          <strong> Formula 1</strong>, and the mindset that drives high
          performance, both in coding and in life.

          I like to focus on <strong>real projects</strong> rather than endless

          something, I care about{" "}
          <strong>
            clean code, usability, and making things that actually work
          </strong>
          .

          Besides iOS, I also enjoy working with <strong>React</strong>. I‚Äôve
          built things like <em>ClientFlow</em>, a client management tool, and a
          dictionary app designed for ease of use. I‚Äôve also hit a few
          milestones along the way, like getting my first app subscription‚Äîsmall
          wins that keep me motivated.

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Right now, I‚Äôm diving into <strong>Next.js</strong> to expand my web
          development skills. I already have experience with{" "}
          <strong>React, Swift, C, and more</strong>, but I always enjoy
          learning new things and improving my workflow.

          This blog is a space where I write about different topics that
          interest me:
          <strong> life lessons, coding, productivity</strong>, and anything
          else that sparks curiosity. It‚Äôs a mix of what I‚Äôm working on, things
          I‚Äôm learning, and challenges I‚Äôve faced along the way.
